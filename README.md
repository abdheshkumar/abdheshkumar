Hi, I'm Abdhesh. I build lots of demos/examples on this account. Most of them are built using Scala/Cats/Cats-effect/circe/zio/shapless/akka/spark, functional Java and React JS.

I work at [Expedia Group, London](https://www.expedia.com/) as a Software Engineer. For information about me, check out [Linkedin profile](https://linkedin.com/in/abdhesh/) and [blogs](https://abdheshkumar.github.io/)
